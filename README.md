# Newgrounds.IO Testings and stuffs

This is a little Unity-Project that i worked up for two days while learning how to usenewgrounds.io because i wanted to learn how to do a WebGL, upload it to newgrounds and add medals and all of those stuff, but funny thing! IDK WHY but i can't seem to export in WebGL.

Like is actually funny that i took me more time trying to export to WebGL that actually learning how to use Newgrounds.IO API.

It's okay tho, i will start making a cool game (not for newgrounds sadly) with a friend, so stay tuned for that :)

BTW uh like i said [here](https://github.com/amySpark-ng/NewgroundsIOTestings/blob/main/UnityProject/NewgroudsTesting/Assets/Scripts/NewgroundsManager.cs) on line 14, im not big coding genius! i just followed some PDF and documentation and begged for it to be good enough, don't take any of the coding here as 100% correct or the best way to do it, just be aware of that

UPDATE: GAME GOT RELEASED FOR ONCE YAY
CHECK IT [HERE](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/834946) ONLY ON NEWGROUNDS BECAUSE IT IS COOL
