# Unity Integrations - by AmySparkNG

Little repo i made to publish some tutorials i've made about libraries and integrations that i've been using in Unity, they kinda been hard for me so i want to help people to understand them better, if they helped you, im glad to hear that! if not, tell me in a repo issue what could be better made, ty :)

IM NO BIG CODING GENIUS TOO! so i might be wrong, just be careful on that ig!
